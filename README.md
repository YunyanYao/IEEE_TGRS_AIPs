System-specific notes
---------------------
The code was tested in Matlab R2016a or higher versions on Windows 10 machines.

How to use it?
---------------------

Directly run demo.m to reproduce the results on the Houston2013 data, which exists in the aforementioned paper.  

Note that the hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Houston2013 data can be downloaded from  
[google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Inpi2_lHuvEWdJX_Duj9ild1_a0LHKmD)  
[baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10nyhL59pmkfxlYpATe0Vxw): 07tt (access code).

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data) and tune the parameters.

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
